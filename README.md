# Horiseon

I was able to make changes to the original HTML code that caused the link not to work for the Search Engine Optimization section, so now you're able to jump to that section when clicking the corresponding link at the top.
I was also able to add the <alt> tags to the images, and I added descriptions of the images, where applicable.

I was able to consolidate <tags> to ensure no multiple code was being written, and to ensure tags that can be combined was combined.

Cleaned up code.
